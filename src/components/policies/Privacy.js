            <br />
            In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.<br />
            <br />
            If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.<br />
            <br />
            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<br />
            Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.<br />
            <br />
            Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.<br />
            <br />
            Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:<br />
            <br />
            Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services<br />

            <br />
            Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.<br />
            <br />
            Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.<br />
            <br />
            We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw consent at any time.<br />
            <br />
            In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:<br />
            If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way<br />
            <br />
            For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br />
            <br />
            For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br />
            <br />
            If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim<br />
            <br />
            For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin<br />
            <br />
            If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse<br />
            <br />
            If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br />
            <br />
            If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records<br />
            <br />
            If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced<br />
            <br />
            If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes<br />
            <br />
            If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations<br />
            <br />

            <br />

You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.<br />
            <br />

            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br />
            <br />
            8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?<br />
            <br />
            In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.<br />
            <br />
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.<br />
            <br />
            9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?<br />
            <br />
            In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.<br />
            <br />
            In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.<br />
            <br />
            We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.<br />
            <br />
            If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.<br />
            <br />
            If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.<br />
            <br />
            Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below or updating your preferences.<br />
            <br />
            However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br />
            <br />
            Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, replying "STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE" to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.<br />
            <br />
            Account Information<br />
            <br />
            If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:<br />
            Log in to your account settings and update your user account.<br />
            <br />
            Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.<br />
            <br />
            Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. You may also opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services.<br />

            If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at privacy@tuneswap.app.<br />
            <br />
            10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES<br />
            <br />
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.<br />

            Verification process<br />
            <br />
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.<br />
            <br />
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.<br />

            <br />
            You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.<br />
            <br />
            You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.<br />
            To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at privacy@tuneswap.app, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.<br />
